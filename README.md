# Head of Credit

***Why Rapidoo?***

For many small businesses, invoice factoring (desconto de duplicatas) is the only place to go when they run into financial difficulties and lose bank credit. Despite being a R$200B / year market, factoring in Brazil is broken. Because processes are antiquated and inefficient, interest rates are much higher than they should be. At Rapidoo (https://rapidoo.com.br), our mission is to fix this problem and help Brazil’s micro-entrepreneurs grow their businesses and create jobs. Using technology to automate operations and to optimize risk management, our self-service online platform offers a much better user experience and fair interest rates.

We are a well-funded, early stage fintech startup looking for somebody to help us scale our credit operation to hundreds of millions of R$ and tens of thousands of customers. You might be our girl or guy if you are self-motivated, self-disciplined, and get excited by the idea of building something big from the ground up that will make a real difference in people’s lives. As a scrappy, diverse team with strong opinions, we strive to move fast and punch above our weight class in everything we do. If you do, too, we’d love to hear from you.

***What you'll do***

-	Reporting to the CEO, you will be responsible for the performance of our portfolio of SMB invoices, managing decisions including approve/decline, pricing, and product structure
-	Design robust, scalable processes for our credit decisions (and, to a lesser degree, collections), allowing us to confidently grow from ~100 to tens of thousands of customers
-	Develop new tools and analyses to build out our credit score model and increasingly automate decision making
-	Develop an intimate understanding of our P&L and operational processes, and how they interact with portfolio performance
-	Create monitoring and reporting tools to track and maintain portfolio performance, both for management purposes and for our lending capital investors and fundraising activities
-	Recruit and manage a world class team of credit analysts and data scientists; create a data-driven culture within the team and throughout the company

***What you'll need***

-	An entrepreneurial attitude is a must – you will not simply be building the credit model, but the whole environment in which the credit modelling can be done as effectively as possible
-	Experience with credit analysis and portfolio management
-	Experience with the design of policies for credit decisions, pricing, and collections
-	Experience with statistics and machine learning techniques, as well as query languages (eg: SQL) and statistical computing languages (eg: Python, R, or SAS)
-	Familiarity with BI tools and processes to help build / shape your reporting infrastructure is a plus

***What you'll get***

-	Competitive compensation with an attractive, Silicon Valley-style equity package
-	True leadership opportunity to build out our Credit function as part of the executive team and become the face of Rapidoo’s FIDC in the investor community
-	Be one of the first employees in a promising fintech startup with a highly qualified team (trained at Harvard Business School, USP, Goldman Sachs, Elo7 and BankFacil; years of experience with factoring)
-	Build your network within the portfolios of our high-profile Brazilian, US and international investors
